# PROJECT_STATE.md

_Source of truth for the current project state. Last updated: 2026-07-09 — visa-checklist feature planned (not yet built); no code changes since `841144c`._

## Identity

- **Live domain:** https://www.nzstudy.help/ (Vercel deployment; also reachable at nz-study-agents.vercel.app)
- **Brand (full):** New Zealand Study Planner - Bangladesh
- **Brand (short UI name):** NZ Study Planner
- **Agent directory feature name:** NZ Study Agent Directory - Bangladesh (use only when referring to the directory feature)
- **Audience:** Bangladeshi students planning to study in New Zealand
- **Positioning:** free, unofficial, student-friendly, trust-first. Not immigration advice; not affiliated with any NZ government body, institute, or agency.

## Git status

- Branch: `main`; remote `origin` → https://github.com/devvnawaz/nz-study-agents.git
- Latest commit: `841144c` — "Update Unitec card image and ignore OS artifacts".
  `npm run build` passes; working tree clean.
- `.gitignore` now covers `.DS_Store` and `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`, so those OS/build
  artifacts no longer appear in `git status`.

## Current features

1. **Institute directory** — `/institutes` list + `/institutes/[id]` detail with
   authorized agents, source links, last-verified dates; client-side search/type/city filter.
   Institute cards use WebP images when available and fall back to the original
   type gradient for institutes without an image.
2. **Agencies** — `/agencies` list + `/agencies/[id]` detail (contacts, institutes represented).
3. **Student Visa FAQ** — `/faq`, 9 categories, `<details>` accordions, official source links.
4. **Interview questions** — `/interview-questions`, 11 grouped categories.
5. **Cost calculator** — `/cost-calculator`; tuition/scholarship/duration/living/one-time inputs;
   NZD + BDT results; **Frankfurter API v2** (`https://api.frankfurter.dev/v2/rate/NZD/BDT`)
   fetched client-side with manual-edit + refresh fallback.
6. **Report outdated info** — `/report` form → POST `/api/reports` (basic validation only).
7. **About** — `/about`.
8. **Admin** — `/manage` (token gate, Agencies/Institutes/Links/CSV Import/Reports tabs);
   `/admin` returns 404; `/api/admin/*` token-gated + in-memory rate limited.

## Tech stack (verified against code)

- Next.js 14.2.5, Pages Router, React 18, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS 3.
- Data layer `src/lib/data.ts` — dual mode: Supabase (production) or local JSON
  file-store `.data/store.json` (demo/dev, seeded from `src/lib/seed.ts`).
- Supabase schema `supabase/schema.sql`: `institutes`, `agencies`, `representations`,
  `reports` + RLS (public SELECT on directory tables, public INSERT on reports).
- ISR: `revalidate: 3600`; dynamic detail pages `fallback: 'blocking'`.
- `@vercel/analytics` in `_app.tsx`. No other runtime deps.

## Deployment approach

- Vercel auto-deploys `main` on push to GitHub. Env vars managed by the user in the
  Vercel dashboard (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`). Never add or change them via tooling.

## Design direction (redesign committed 2026-07-08, `2914959`)

- Reference: user screenshot "New Design I want to Achieve.png" (dark navy + teal).
- Tokens: `ink` (navy/slate) + `accent` (teal) added in `tailwind.config.js`;
  legacy `brand`/`nz` kept for compatibility. Shared classes in `globals.css`
  (`.btn-primary` teal, `.btn-dark`, `.input`, `.select`, `.alert-*`, `.card`).
- Dark navy sticky header + dark footer on all pages; homepage hero with badge,
  "Your Path to **New Zealand** Starts Here", stats row, floating search card
  overlapping the hero; modern institute cards with photo headers where assets
  exist, otherwise gradient "image" headers + SVG type icons; `PageHeader` navy
  band on inner pages; `Alert` component for disclaimers; inline SVG icon set
  (`src/components/icons.tsx`) replacing emoji.
- **Hero photo:** `public/images/hero-nz.jpg` exists and is used by
  `HeroBackdrop.tsx` under a navy overlay; if removed, the hero falls back to the
  SVG mountain silhouette.
- **Institute card images:** stored in `public/images/institutes/*.webp`.
  `src/components/InstituteCard.tsx` maps known demo IDs and normalized production
  institute names to those filenames. Current assets: `inst-aut`, `inst-canterbury`,
  `inst-eit`, `inst-lincoln`, `inst-massey`, `inst-otago`, `inst-unitec`,
  `inst-uoa`, `inst-vuw`, `inst-waikato`.

## Known limitations / cautions

- Public `/api/reports` is protected by an in-memory rate limit (5 per 10 min per
  IP) plus a honeypot field and length caps (committed in `3f70f00`). The limiter
  is per-serverless-instance (in-memory), so it is best-effort on Vercel —
  acceptable for this traffic; a distributed limiter is a later upgrade. No CAPTCHA.
- No sitemap.xml, robots.txt, or structured data yet.
- Branding strings are repeated across pages (no central site config).
- Production Supabase holds real data (user-confirmed 2026-07-08). Any remaining
  "(DEMO)"-labelled seed entries are placeholders; never invent data.
- CSV importer matches by exact normalized name; create-or-skip only (no update).
- npm audit warnings exist from the `@vercel/analytics` install (unaddressed).
- Production admin actions need the user's real `ADMIN_TOKEN` — never request or log it.
- `src/pages/manage/index.tsx` (~785 lines) is the most complex file; it was NOT
  restyled in the redesign (deliberately out of scope).
- Image matching for institute cards is deliberately explicit. If production
  Supabase has provider names that differ from the current normalized-name checks,
  add a mapping in `InstituteCard.tsx` rather than relying on broad fuzzy matching.

## Planned feature: Visa checklist (agreed 2026-07-09, not yet built)

- **Route:** `/visa-checklist` — one profile-driven page, NOT four separate pages.
- **Profile selector:** chip groups (calculator-duration-chip pattern) for study
  level (Bachelor's / Master's — possibly PhD, see open question) and family
  situation (Just me / With spouse-partner / With spouse & children).
- **Checklist composition:** typed data modules (base + master's add-on + spouse
  add-on + children add-on) composed at render time — same data-array pattern as
  the FAQ page.
- **Items:** checkbox + title + 1–2 cautious sentences + INZ source links (reuse
  FAQ `SourceLinks` pattern); grouped sections (Identity, Study, Financial,
  Health & Character, Family); progress counter; ticked state in **localStorage**
  (no accounts, per the no-auth decision).
- **Scope guards:** static client-side page — no DB/schema/API changes, no new
  dependencies; keeps warning `Alert` + cautious wording (preparation aid, not an
  official requirements list); no PDF export for now.
- **Nav impact:** adds a 7th nav item — accept tighter `lg` spacing for now;
  revisit a "Resources" dropdown only when an 8th item appears.
- **OPEN QUESTIONS (blocking start, awaiting user):**
  1. Content source — agent drafts cautious wording + INZ links (like FAQ), or
     user supplies a prepared list?
  2. Study-level split — Bachelor's/Master's only, or also PhD (different work
     rights/family rules) / diploma-polytechnic?

## Exact next task

1. **Visa checklist feature** — once the user answers the two open questions
   above, build `/visa-checklist` per the plan.
2. **SEO basics** — add `public/robots.txt` and a sitemap; consider JSON-LD
   structured data for FAQ and directory pages.
3. Optionally verify the deployed spam protection on production: a 6th rapid
   submission to `/report` should return 429 (limiter is per-instance, so this is
   best-effort on Vercel).
4. Ongoing data upkeep: keep agent listings verified against official institute
   pages via the CSV importer in `/manage`.

Completed verification note (2026-07-08): all 10 institute card images + hero
photo confirmed rendering on production against real Supabase names (UUID IDs →
name-based matching), including the "Eastern Institute of Technology - EIT"
variant; zero gradient fallbacks.
